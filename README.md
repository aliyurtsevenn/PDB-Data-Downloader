# PDB-Data-Downloader
This code downloads PDB IDs of given corresponding genes automatically into a given directory. You can determine how many chemical components should be downloaded at most for each gene. You can add many genes for downloading at the same time, but if the data size is too big, there might be an error in the server. Both parameters_pdb.txt file and given code should be in the same directory. Otherwise, the code doesn't work properly.
